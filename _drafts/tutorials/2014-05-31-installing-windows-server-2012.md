heading: Part of a series Installing and Configuring Windows Server 2012 doesn't require a server backend. But sooner or later you'll want to start adding some features that require interaction with a server. A common feature is to provide a login, or password protect a page of the site. Trying to achieve this using a static site generator alone is not possible, but with the help of an identity management and function-as-a-service solution, you can easily secure sections or even your whole site.
